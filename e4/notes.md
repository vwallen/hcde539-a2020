# E4: Motor Build 
Victor Allen (vwallen@uw.edu)
## Description
My inital plan was to take this build in a different direction and make a small coffin opening / vampire thing for Halloween. Unfortunately, time intervened and I did not get to the build before the holiday, or even in time to catch any sales at the craft stores. So instead, it's a plastic box tht opens and closes.

I did design and 3D print a pivoting arm mechanism that is run by the servo. This took quite a bit of iteration, and really far to long, but it is oddly satisfying to watch.

## Source

I used Circuit Python for this project. The source file can be found on GitHub:

## Notes
* This was absolutely the wrong time to go for an ambitous build!
* The opportunities to combine physical computing and 3D printing is so great. Combining these two interests is one of the reasons I took this class. However, this project was a reminder that I am not a mechanical engineer.
* For a long-term build, figuring out how to turn off the signal to the servo when unnecessary is going to be essential. There are a lot of angles which cause the servo to buzz, even at rest.
* I need to combine this with the motion sensor.
